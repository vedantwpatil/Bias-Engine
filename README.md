# Bias Engine

The goal of this project is to be able to determine how risky a company is based on the recent news, the way we hope to accomplish this is by utilizing langchain to connect with a llm and have a mcp server for our llm to scrape the internet for relevant news articles.

After this we then have a NLP process to determine the bias and overall come to a evaluation using a algorithm to conclude the risk of investing in the company
